**Daniel Panario**: _Discrete logarithm computations and the distribution of irreducible factors of polynomials over finite fields_

Abstract:

Discrete logarithm computations and their use in cryptography are one of the many areas of research of Alfred Menezes. In this talk, we review a methodology that allows us to prove diverse results about the distribution of the irreducible factors of polynomials over finite fields. This technique was originally used by Odlyzko to prove that the index calculus method to compute discrete logarithms in finite fields has subexponential cost. We review Odlyzko's results and comment on other uses of this methodology in discrete logarithm computations.

**Sam Jaques**: _Another look at quantum cryptanalysis_

In the second round of the NIST post-quantum process, the scheme SIKE reduced its key sizes. Alfred Menezes was a critical factor in this, publishing a revised estimate of classical attack costs and encouraging myself and John Schanck to work on quantum attack costs. But doesn’t this contradict Schneier's law that “attacks only get better”? In this talk I’ll explain how quantum attack costs were overestimated, but also talk about *why*, and rant about the philosophy of science and what Alfred taught me about the realities of the scientific process and its institutions.

**Gora Adj**: _Title: The Journey of MPC-in-the-Head in Post-Quantum Cryptography_

The MPC-in-the-Head paradigm transforms secure multiparty computation protocols into efficient zero-knowledge proofs, and from there to digital signatures. This approach has become a cornerstone in post-quantum signature schemes for their competitive efficiency and the simplicity of their security proofs. In this talk, we will survey the MPC-in-the-Head signatures that entered the onramp NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization process, outlining their core design principles and making comparisons between them and against the other NIST candidates.
